    <h1>What is Hepatitis A?</h1>
		<!-- Source for (1): https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-a -->
		<p>Hepatitis A is an inflammation of the liver that is primarily spread through the ingestion of food or water contaminated with the Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), in which the contamination is often due to contact with fecal matter of an infected person. Unlike Hepatitis B and C, it does not lead to chronic liver disease, but it can still be fatal -- in rare cases, it can eventually lead to acute liver failure, or fulminant hepatitis (1).</p>
