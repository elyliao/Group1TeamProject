		<h1>What is Hepatitis A?</h1>
			<p>Hepatitis A is an inflammation of the liver that is primarily spread through the ingestion of food or water contaminated with the Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), in which the contamination is often due to contact with fecal matter of an infected person. Unlike Hepatitis B and C, it does not lead to chronic liver disease, but it can still be fatal -- in rare cases, it can eventually lead to acute liver failure, or fulminant hepatitis (1).</p>
		<h2>How it's transmitted:</h2>
			<dl>
				<dt>Close contact with an infected person.</dt>
					<dd>- Sexual contact</dd>
					<dd>- Caring for an infected person</dd>
				<dt>Consuming contaminated items.</dt>
					<dd>- Food items can be contaminated anytime from the growing process to even after cooking (2).</dd>
